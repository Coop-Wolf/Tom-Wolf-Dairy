## Pregnancy Report
### Cooper Wolf
### Description:

This program reads in data from a pregnancy report sheet which includes the cow, the sire, and the breed date. This program calculates the dates in which the cow will go dry (milk production ceases prior to calving), when the cow needs to be brought in for better treatment (making sure shes healthy and feeding her extra), and the expected date she will deliver her calf.
